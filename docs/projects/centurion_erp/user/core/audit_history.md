Audit History provides for models a full history of the changes made to a model. This history is recorded for all create and update operations against a model.


## View a models History

Each model that has history enabled will on their details page, display the history icon in the top right hand corner of the window. Clicking on this will display (latest first), the entire history of the model. Once a history entry has been made for an item, no one including a `super_admin` can edit or delete a history entry. The only time a history entry is removed, is when the model is removed from the database.

Each history entry has the changes collapsed, for ease of finding the history entry you desire. On locating the entry you desire, click its expand icon on the right of the entries row.
